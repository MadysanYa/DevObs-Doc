Assumptions:
•	VM-1 will act as the MySQL master.
•	VM-2 will act as the MySQL slave.
•	Both VMs are running Linux (e.g., Ubuntu).

Configure MySQL on VM-1 (Master)
1. Install MySQL Server
If MySQL is not already installed on VM-1, install it:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install mysql-server

2. Configure MySQL for Replication
Edit the MySQL configuration file (/etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf or /etc/my.cnf) on VM-1:
sudo nano /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf

Add or modify the following lines under the [mysqld] section:
server-id = 1
log_bin = /var/log/mysql/mysql-bin.log
binlog_do_db = your_database_name
Replace your_database_name with the name of the database you want to replicate.

3. Restart MySQL Service
Restart MySQL to apply the configuration changes:
sudo systemctl restart mysql

4. Create Replication User
Log in to MySQL as root:
sudo mysql -u root -p

Run the following SQL commands to create a replication user and grant necessary privileges:
CREATE USER 'repl'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_replication_password';
GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO 'repl'@'%';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

5. Note Down Master Status
While still in the MySQL shell, note down the current binary log file name (File) and position (Position). You'll need this information later for configuring the slave server on VM-2:
SHOW MASTER STATUS;

Configure MySQL on VM-2 (Slave)
1. Install MySQL Server
If MySQL is not already installed on VM-2, install it:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install mysql-server

2. Configure MySQL for Replication
Edit the MySQL configuration file (/etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf or /etc/my.cnf) on VM-2:
sudo nano /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf

Add or modify the following lines under the [mysqld] section:
server-id = 2

3. Restart MySQL Service
Restart MySQL to apply the configuration changes:
sudo systemctl restart mysql

4. Set Up Replication on VM-2
Log in to MySQL as root:
sudo mysql -u root -p

Run the following SQL commands to configure the slave to replicate from the master (VM-1). Replace master_log_file and master_log_pos with the values obtained from SHOW MASTER STATUS; on VM-1.

CHANGE MASTER TO
  MASTER_HOST='vm1_ip_address',
  MASTER_USER='repl',
  MASTER_PASSWORD='your_replication_password',
  MASTER_LOG_FILE='master_log_file_from_vm1',
  MASTER_LOG_POS=master_log_pos_from_vm1;

Replace vm1_ip_address with the IP address or hostname of VM-1 where MySQL master is running.

5. Start Slave Replication on VM-2
START SLAVE;

6. Verify Slave Status on VM-2
SHOW SLAVE STATUS \G;

Ensure that Slave_IO_Running and Slave_SQL_Running both show Yes, indicating that replication is working correctly.
